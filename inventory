# Each environment for Launch Configuration must be defined here

# Ensure each environment follows the example below and also create a file called group_vars/<environment>/vars.yml to hold environment specific settings

# If you have x launch configuration, then ideally you will have x env & the vars for each can be loaded from group_var folder as mentioned in previous steps.

# Role can be common but the var & env changes based on LaunchConfig
