# Each environment for Launch Configuration must be defined here

# Ensure each environment follows the example below and also create a file called group_vars/<environment>/vars.yml to hold environment specific settings

# If you have x launch configuration, then ideally you will have x env & the vars for each can be loaded from group_var folder as mentioned in previous steps.

# Role can be common but the var & env changes based on LaunchConfig

# Use ansible_python_interpreter only when you notice error in loading boto module. Example Error msg `"msg": "boto3 required for this module"`
